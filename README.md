# Introduction
Odin Recipes is the first project created using the knowledge attained from The Odin Project Foundations Course. From this point, we have completed the 'Git Basics', 'HTML Foundations', and 'Intro to CSS' and are now ready to apply our learning. 

Sweet Talker is a curation of recipes found all over the web, most notably Instagram and TikTok. Simple recipes to enjoy with loved ones. There is always room for dessert!
